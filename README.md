🧩 Automation Testing Project using Selenium and Java

📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Automation Testing using Selenium WebDriver, Java, and TestNG in Eclipse IDE. 
The main objective of this project is to automate functional workflows of a sample web application to ensure the reliability and efficiency of its core features. 
The scripts are designed to perform automated actions such as launching browsers, creating new user accounts, handling forms, managing radio buttons, entering data, and verifying successful login and UI interactions.
The project provides a comprehensive example of how manual test cases can be translated into automated scripts using Selenium, reducing testing time and improving consistency.
It follows the Page Object Model (POM) structure to make the code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

⚙️ Key Features

Automated execution of core web application functionalities including:
Browser launching and control (Commandbrowser.java)
User account creation (Createnewaccount.java)
Login validation (LoginTCS7.java)
Handling web elements and forms (Searchelements.java, Enterdatacheck.java)
Working with radio buttons and inputs (Radiobuttons.java)
Data-driven testing using custom data files (data.java)
Designed and developed using Selenium WebDriver API with Java for cross-browser testing.
Implemented TestNG framework for test execution, validation, and reporting.
Employed Assertions and Verifications for validating expected vs. actual results.
Modular structure ensures maintainability and scalability for future enhancements.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java
Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver
Testing Framework: TestNG
IDE: Eclipse
Build Tool: Maven (optional)
Browser Drivers: ChromeDriver
OS: Windows

📈 Outcome

The automation framework effectively simulates real user actions on a browser, executing test cases faster and more accurately compared to manual testing.
This project demonstrates practical automation testing experience, strengthens understanding of Selenium WebDriver, and showcases test framework design, execution flow, and report generation aligned with industry standards.
